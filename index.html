	<h3>An adventure game of holy fools and unholy deeds.</h3>
	<p>Pilgrims Of Misfortune is an adventure game about pilgrims exploring a world of magic and wonder. Players take on the roles of pilgrims searching for holy shrines and relics. The simple rules hearken back to old school tabletop adventure games where the fictional world takes the spotlight. It is heavily influenced by games like Cairn and The Black Hack.</p>
